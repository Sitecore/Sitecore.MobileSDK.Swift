Buses\ncan be found on Bay St, but figuring out the routes can be\ncomplicated for a tourist. Taxis are common and often take the form\nof minivans. They are identifiable by their yellow license plates\nand 'Taxi' signs in black lettering. Most come equipped with meters\nbut it is best to agree on a fare in advance.","Image":"<image src=\"~/media/92E3AF14EC664A3FAEE7E38CBE792D9C.ashx\" mediaid=\"{7E7DD93C-9A76-4A4A-A0B4-0FED087A8161}\" mediapath=\"/Images/Imported/3/2/6/a/nassau\" />","IP":"","Kids Attractions":"","Latitude":"25.06","Longitude":"-77.345","Name":"Nassau","Nightlife":"","Overview":"<p>Known for its balmy breezes, sunny skies and sugary white\nbeaches, Nassau has had a turbulent past. Capital of the Bahamas\nand the largest city, Nassau was first settled by the English and\nthen became a home base for notorious pirates such as the likes of\nEdward Teach, better known as Blackbeard, only to have all been\nkilled or driven out by the British by 1720. The city then went on\nto be burned to the ground by the Spanish on three different\noccasions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nowadays, the island's close proximity to the US gives Nassau a\ndistinctly American flavour. This bustling hub of a city is a\ndelightful and colourful blend of old world and colonial\narchitecture juxtaposed by a busy port. Boasting a prized sheltered\nharbour, Nassau made history with its beautifully preserved\nVictorian buildings, 18th-century fortresses and Queen's Staircase,\nthe 66 steps of which lead to the most breathtaking view over the\nwhole of Nassau - a must for any visitor!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Garden enthusiasts should visit the Royal Victorian Garden,\nwhich has more than 300 species of tropical plants and exotic\ncreatures. Enthusiastic shoppers on the other hand would be\nwell-advised to look out for great bargains at the Straw Market on\nBay Street. Alternatively visitors can relax by spending an idle\nafternoon watching a cricket game at one of the many local sports\ngrounds. After dark, Nassau comes alive with a rowdy bar and club\nscene, and the scent of fresh seafood permeates the air in the Fish\nFry district.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This stunning city can also add four guest roles in the movies\nto its resume, starring in three James Bond pictures as well as the\nBeatles film 'Help!' With bright lights of casinos, posh resort\nhotels and cruise liners, Nassau is overflowing with variety,\ncolour and exciting nightlife.
